<h3 class="intro">   
  
  Lately, the world is becoming more unsafe by the day. It's important for every human being-regardless of race, gender, and identity- to be proctected against any threat that presents itself. In desperate times, when there's no authorities around to save you, you have to be prepared for the worse situation possible. That's why I compiled self defense items that are proficient against fending off an attacker. This website was created as a practice to apply fundamental HTML & CSS syntaxes as I learned in the CodeNation program. The following is the end results. This website is incomplete, but harbors many examples of various web development functions. Made By Denise Fernandez

  <h3> This easily concealable and discreet knife is disguised as a hair brush. Plus, it's pretty efficient at brushing your hair, too. Stay protected while having your hair slayed. By removing this items' bristles and handle, it becomes an effective dagger with a stainless steel blade. At 6.25" inches overall, it's small enough to fit in any bag. A knife is a more well known product when self defense comes to mind, and it's no wonder why. It's also proficient in slicing your fruits and veggies. This item is the definition of multi-purposeful.

     <h3>
      This here is the most common self defense item used and known: Pepper spray. It is very efficient in immobilizing targets. Pepper spray is a pungent substance that is made of chili peppers. When sprayed at a target, it burns eyes, stings nose, and makes it difficult to breathe. This distracts your target and allows you to flee or get help. It's legal in many places, and the fact that it's compact makes it easy to carry. I'd say that this is one of the generic self defense devices, but for good reason.

     <h3>
This taser built into a phone case is extremely innovative. Not only is it stylish, it's also electrifying. We love multi-purposeful items. The only down side to this phone case is that it only comes in two phone sizes, and they're very old: iPhone 6 and 6s. All the iPhone X's, 11's, 12's, (Shoutout to all my iPhone 12 users!) and 13's have lucked out. Oh- and you too, Android. Anywho, other than the immense down side that it's very phone uninclusive, it's still a great idea nonetheless. Plus, the developers on their website say that they're working on making new sizes. (Hurray!) As soon as it's announced, you better hop on that product, because honestly imagine all the possibilities of it's use. Someone creepy behind you? "Hold on, let me just answer this call-" *electric crackling noises can be heard* Boom. Now you run away. See it's versatility? Anyway, this one is definitely a favorite for me. </h3>
